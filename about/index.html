            <p>
                Hatch is a third-party project hosting service for projects made
                using Scratch and TurboWarp. Scratch is a great option to learn
                the fundamentals of programming, but it is designed for young
                children. Many Scratchers understandably find themselves
                outgrowing Scratch as they get older, and/or have distaste for
                new Scratch features, but they want to keep using the Scratch
                editor to create projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hatch was designed with this group of users in mind. While we're
                very similar to Scratch, having a close online community, we
                have more relaxed rules, allowing for more content types and
                genres that may not be suitable for the Scratch website.
            </p>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>Who can join Hatch?</h3>
            <p>
                We allow anyone who is aged 13 or older to join. If you are
                under 13, you are welcome to use Hatch while logged out and
                access any non-restricted projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Why should I use Hatch?</h3>
            <p>
                There are other good third-party options for hosting Scratch
                projects. However, Hatch is far less limited. We are very
                transparent between the Hatch Team and Hatchlings (users), and
                our rules are much more relaxed. We also contain features that
                some other similar sites may not, such as commenting.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I advertise Hatch or my Hatch Projects on Scratch?</h3>
            <p>
                No. Scratch has rules that prohibit sharing links to websites
                with looser moderation guidelines, because Scratch is a platform
                for users of all ages.
                <strong
                    >Please do not share links to Hatch or mention Hatch
                    anywhere on the Scratch website.</strong
                >
            </p>
