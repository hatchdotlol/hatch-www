        <p>
            Hatch is a third-party project hosting service for projects made
            using Scratch and TurboWarp. Scratch is a great option to learn
            the fundamentals of programming, but it is designed for young
            children. Many Scratchers understandably find themselves
            outgrowing Scratch as they get older, and/or have distaste for
            new Scratch features, but they want to keep using the Scratch
            editor to create projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hatch was designed with this group of users in mind. While we're
            very similar to Scratch, having a close online community, we
            have more relaxed rules, allowing for more content types and
            genres that may not be suitable for the Scratch website.
        </p>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Who can join Hatch?</h3>
        <p>
            We allow anyone who is aged 13 or older to join. If you are
            under 13, you are welcome to use Hatch while logged out and
            access any projects that aren't age restricted.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should I use Hatch?</h3>
        <p>
            There are other good third-party options for hosting Scratch
            projects. However, Hatch is far less limited. We are very
            transparent between the Hatch Team and Hatchlings (users), and
            our rules are much more relaxed. We also contain features that
            some other similar sites may not, such as commenting.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I advertise Hatch or my Hatch Projects on Scratch?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Scratch has rules that prohibit sharing links to websites
            with looser moderation guidelines, because Scratch is a platform
            for users of all ages.
            <strong>Please do not share links to Hatch or mention Hatch
                anywhere on the Scratch website.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>There's a ratings system? How does that work?</h3>
        <p>
            See
            <a href="/about/moderation/#project-ratings">Guide to Moderation ยง Project Ratings</a>
            for more information.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I trust you guys?</h3>
        <p>
            Of course! We have a transparent
            <a href="/about/privacy/">privacy policy</a> that explains how
            your data is used. We don't sell or share your data, and we
            fully respect your privacy and comply with requests for data
            deletion. If you have any questions, you can email
